# BasicWeatherApi Solution

Small project I started to improve my C#.NET skills.
This solution contains two projects for fetching and displaying weather data using [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs):

## Projects

- **[Console Version](BasicWeatherApi.Console/)**
  A console application that retrieves and prints weather data based on user settings.

- **[Web API Version](BasicWeatherApi.Web/)**
  A web application with a user interface to fetch and display weather forecasts.

## Setup

```bash
dotnet run --project BasicWeatherApi.Console
dotnet run --project BasicWeatherApi.Web
