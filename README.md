# Basic Weather Front API

Small project I started to improve my C#.NET skills.
The application uses a predefined list of cities the user can choose from, requests weather data from [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and parses it for the frontend to display it.

[Console Version](BasicWeatherApi.Console/README.md)
[Web API Version](BasicWeatherApi.Web/README.md) _Not implemented yet!_

This readme will be updated soon with proper information.
